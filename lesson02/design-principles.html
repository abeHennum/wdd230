          <h4>Rule of Thirds</h4>
          <p>The Church Of Jesus Christ Of Latter Day Saints</p>

          <p>
            The rule of thirds can be explained as a way that photos are
            strategically taken. A 3 by 3 grid is placed over an image and the
            object that is intended to catch the veiwers interest is placed in
            the intersections of the rows and columns. The image on The Church
            Of Jesus Christs website is an example of this principle. The face
            of the little girl being hugged by Jesus is placed in the
            intersections of the imaginary grid lines. This website demonstrates
            the rule of thirds.

          <p>
            White space and clear design can be defined as any blank or empty
            space surrounding all the other elements in a design composition. It
            is the space between text, images, buttons and other objects that a
            user can see on a page or a screen. When correctly applied this
            principle can make for a more visually pleasing website. I think
            that Nike's wesbite has good aplication of the white space and clear
            design rule as its elements are appropriately spaced with the right
            amount of space around and between the elements of the page.

          <p>
            Proximity can be explained as related items on a website being
            placed together. This allows for easier user navagation and a more
            enjoyable experience. I think that the bed bath and beyond website
            is a good example of these design principles in action. This website
            groups together elements such as current deals and different classes
            of furniture.
